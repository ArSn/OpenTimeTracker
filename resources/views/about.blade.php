							<small>What is Open Time Tracker?</small>
						</h1>
						<p>Open Time Tracker is a very simple tool to track your working hours. It arose by the feel
							of <a href="https://github.com/ArSn">one lazy web developer</a> to track his working hours
							in a browser and have the times in an online database.</p>
						<p>Right now the system is not even very feature-rich, but the beforementioned lazy developer
							promised to add a few more features over time. However the page will never become overloaded
							with a lot of features; as this was one of the main goals of this project: Simplicity to do
							one thing and one thing only, and doing that thing just right.</p>
						<p>If you are a developer yourself (or know any), feel free to contribute and/or open feature
							requests that will kindly be considered:
							<a href="https://github.com/ArSn/OpenTimeTracker">https://github.com/ArSn/OpenTimeTracker</a>
							<br/>Well actually, feel free to do so even if you are not a developer! Don't be shy, we
							won't bite.</p>
						<p>So long, and thanks for all the fish!</p>
